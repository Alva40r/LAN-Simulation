# My LAN on Cisco Packet Tracer

## Objective

This project's objective is to recreate my LAN on Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate any changes that I would make to my physical LAN beforehand.

### Skills Learned

- Configured router's DHCP server with a set number of users(30)
- Implemented router's wireless security by using WPA2 encryption, and by hiding the SSID.
- Created a guest network on the router.
- Checked connectivity on all the devices using the ping command on all the devices.

### Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Command Line Interface on the devices.
- Router's GUI
